# kmers.py

A pure Python proof-of-concept protein classifier.

## Usage

### Generating *k*-mer distributions

First, create an empty Composition object, supplying the value of k.

    composition = kmers.Composition(k=3)

Add a Bio.SeqRecord object to it.
If there are many sequences (and there typically are), it's preferable to set `update=False` to avoid costly
recomputation of log distribution after adding every single one.

    composition.process(seq, update=False)

Log distribution can be ordered manually:

    self.update_relative()


### Analyzing distributions
Given sequence a_seq, you can find probability it was generated by this distribuition.
This task is typical for classification problems

    p = composition.prob(a_seq)

Given two Composition objects, you can find distance between them. Currently only n-dimensional Euclidean  and
feature frequency profile (Sims et al. 2008) distance metrics are supported.

    e = kmers.euclidean(comp_a, comp_b)
    f = kmers.ffp_distance(comp_a, comp_b)
