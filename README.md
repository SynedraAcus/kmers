# kmers.py

A pure Python proof-of-concept protein classifier.

## Usage

*create a Composition object, supplying the value of k*

composition = kmers.Composition(k=3)

*add some Bio.SeqRecord sequences.*

*If there are many sequences (and there typically are), it's preferable to set update=False to avoid costly
recomputation of log distribution after adding every single one.*

composition.process(seq, update=False)

*Build log distribution*

self.update_relative()

*Given sequence a_seq, what's the probability it was generated by this distribuition?*

p = composition.prob(a_seq)
