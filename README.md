# kmers.py

A pure Python3 *k*-mer analysis library.
This library is agnostic to a type of sequences used and treats them
internally as strings.
## Installation
Python2 is not supported. For python3 it's best to use PyPI.

    pip3 install kmers

## Usage

### Generating *k*-mer distributions

First, create a Composition object, supplying the value of k.
Initial data can be supplied either through `seq` (see self.process) or
`fh`, which accepts a file-like object and reads the composition data
from a file. If both are omitted, an empty Composition object is
created.

    import kmers.kmers as kmers
    composition = kmers.Composition(k=3, seq=None, fh=None)

Data can be added to an existing model later. You can add either a
single SeqRecord object or an iterable of SeqRecords.
If your code intents to call this method many times, it's preferable to set `update=False` to avoid costly
recomputation of log distribution after every call.

    composition.process(seq, update=False)

You can recompute log distribution manually:

    self.update_relative()


### Analyzing distributions
Given sequence a_seq, you can find probability it was generated by this distribuition.
Comparing such probabilities for a series of distributions is a primitive,
but functional sequence classifier.

    p = composition.prob(a_seq)

Given two Composition objects, you can find distance between them. Currently only n-dimensional Euclidean  and
feature frequency profile (Sims et al. 2008) distance metrics are supported.

    e = kmers.euclidean(comp_a, comp_b)
    f = kmers.ffp_distance(comp_a, comp_b)
